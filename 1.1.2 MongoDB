MongoDB Query (5 points):

‚óè Write a MongoDB query to find all posts created by a specific user,
including the user details.


MongoDB Aggregation Framework to perform a $lookup operation to join the Post collection with the User collection. This will allow you to retrieve posts along with the associated user details.

js:

db.Post.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      author: ObjectId("userObjectId"), // Replace with the ObjectId of the specific user
    },
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "User",
      localField: "author",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "userDetails",
    },
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$userDetails",
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      title: 1,
      content: 1,
      created_at: 1,
      user: {
        _id: "$userDetails._id",
        username: "$userDetails.username",
        email: "$userDetails.email",
        fullName: "$userDetails.fullName",
        created_at: "$userDetails.created_at",
      },
    },
  },
]);

Explanation:

$match Stage:
Filters the posts based on the specified user's ObjectId.

$lookup Stage:
Performs a left outer join with the User collection.
Connects the author field in the Post collection with the _id field in the User collection.
Stores the user details in an array called userDetails.

$unwind Stage:
Deconstructs the userDetails array, creating a new document for each element.

$project Stage:
Shapes the output of the aggregation.
Selects specific fields from the Post collection.
Embeds the user details within each post.
